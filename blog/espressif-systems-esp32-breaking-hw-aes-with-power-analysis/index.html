                <div class="post-single-content" background-color="0xff"><p>Side Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks are commonly used for extracting the secret key of cryptographic engines found in modern devices. They exploit side channels, such as <em>Timing</em>, <em>Power</em> and <em>Electromagnetic</em> (EM) leaks, to obtain information about the secret key used by the cryptography algorithm. Even though these type of attacks were traditionally performed on smart cards, they are effective on embedded devices as well.</p>
<p>Even the strongest cryptography algorithms, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>, are susceptible to SCA attacks, especially if no countermeasures are in place. That&rsquo;s why, <a href="https://donjon.ledger.com/">Ledger Dojon</a>&rsquo;s discovery that the key used by the flash encryption feature of the ESP32 chip could be extracted through a power analysis attack, was not surprising. Nonetheless, their in-depth research is very cool and we definitely recommend to watch their <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/briefings/schedule/#unlimited-results-breaking-firmware-encryption-of-esp32-v3-26345">Black Hat presentation</a> and read their <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/090.pdf">paper</a>. Espressif released an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/AR2022-003%20Security%20Advisory%20Concerning%20Breaking%20the%20Hardware%20AES%20Core%20and%20Firmware%20Encryption%20of%20ESP32%20Chip%20Revision%20v3.0%20-%20V2.0%20EN.pdf">advisory</a> related to their research results.</p>
<p>Ledger&rsquo;s research inspired us, especially because we use the ESP32 chip for our hardware security trainings, to break the hardware AES engine using a power analysis attack as well. The results of this activity are described in this blog post. Other interesting examples include SCA attacks on the <a href="https://hardwear.io/netherlands-2022/speakers/tihmstar.php">iPhone</a> (EM), <a href="https://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/Xbox_360_Timing_Attack">Xbox 360</a> (Timing) and <a href="https://eshard.com/posts/sca-attacks-on-armv8">ARMv8 Cryptographic Extensions (CE)</a> (EM).</p>
<p>Please note, in this blog post we will not explain the theory behind power analysis attacks, notably Correlation Power Attacks (CPA) on the AES algorithm. There&rsquo;s an abundance of information publicly available where these attacks are described in utmost detail and clarity. For example, by <a href="https://yan1x0s.medium.com/side-channel-attacks-part-2-dpa-cpa-applied-on-aes-attack-66baa356f03f">Yan1x0s</a>, <a href="https://nostarch.com/hardwarehacking">Colin O&rsquo;Flynn and Jasper van Woudenberg</a>, <a href="https://wiki.newae.com/V4:Tutorial_B6_Breaking_AES_%28Manual_CPA_Attack%29">NewAE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Riscure/Jlsca">Ceesb</a> and <a href="https://www.rambus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DPA.pdf">Paul Kocher</a>. We definitely used their write-ups for inspiration and reference.</p>
<h2 id="test-application">Test application</h2>
<p>The first thing we had to find out is how to communicate with the hardware AES engine of the ESP32 chip. Conveniently, the ESP32 chip includes a built-in ROM API to decrease the complexity of interfacing with its hardware features, including the hardware AES engine. We simply used this ROM API in order to set the key and perform an encryption with the AES engine. We use a standard GPIO pin to determine where exactly this ROM API call is executed and to align our measurement with the oscilloscope. A simplified snippet of our test application is shown below.</p>

<p>When we execute the above test application it results in a trigger window (i.e., time between trigger up and down) of roughly 3.1 μs as is shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

    <figcaption>Trigger window (time between trigger up and down)</figcaption>
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to point out that the receiving of input data and sending of output data is outside of this trigger window.</p>
<h2 id="power-domain">Power domain</h2>
<p>The ESP32&rsquo;s hardware AES engine is powered according to the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_technical_reference_manual_en.pdf">Technical Reference Manual</a> by the <code>VDD3P3_CPU</code> power domain. On most development boards, including the ones we have access to, it&rsquo;s not trivial to control this power domain separately from the others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to modify the development board, as shown by <a href="https://limitedresults.com/2019/08/pwn-the-esp32-crypto-core/">Limited Results</a>, however, that&rsquo;s not ideal for security trainings as it&rsquo;s time consuming and fragile. Moreover, we noticed that the placement of the <code>VDD3P3_CPU</code> pin is drastically different between the <code>ESP32-D0WD</code> and <code>ESP32-D0WDQ6</code>, which makes it even more annoying to make the required modification. Therefore, we decided, in similar fashion as <a href="https://github.com/Ledger-Donjon/scaffold">Ledger&rsquo;s scaffold</a>, to make our own custom board where all the relevant signals are routed to dedicated pins.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

    <figcaption>Raelize's custom ESP32 board (v0)</figcaption>
</p>
<p>If you are interested, the schematics of this board can be found <a href="/img/esp32/sca/rlz-esp32-v0-schematics.png">here</a>. There are a few issues with the board and therefore we are currently in the process of making an updated version of this board with several improvements.</p>
<h2 id="power-analysis-setup">Power analysis setup</h2>
<p>We use Riscure&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.riscure.com/products/current-probe/">Current Probe</a> to measure the current of the <code>VDD3P3_CPU</code> power domain, which is powered by two AA batteries in series to create a clean voltage signal of about 3 volts. Inside this device, the power signal (i.e., current carrying conductor) goes through a current transformer in order to measure the fluctuations in the power consumption.</p>
<p>The advantage of using the Current Probe, compared to the typical <em>&lsquo;measure the voltage drop over a resistor approach&rsquo;</em>, is its low impedance and a high sensitivity. The output of the Current Probe, as well as the GPIO pin used for the trigger, are connected to a <a href="https://www.picotech.com/oscilloscope/3000/picoscope-3000-oscilloscope-specifications">Picoscope 3206D</a> oscilloscope. We use a standard FTDI-based USB-to-UART adapter to communicate with the ESP32 chip. A diagram of the power analysis setup that we used is shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/power-setup.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Power Analysis setup</figcaption>
</p>
<p>The actual setup in our lab is shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/power-setup-real.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Power Analysis setup</figcaption>
</p>
<p>We use Riscure&rsquo;s FiPy to control the setup during the acquisition. This is a Python framework that is controlled and access from the browser. It&rsquo;s shown below during the acquisition of multiple encryption operations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/fipy.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Riscure's FiPy</figcaption>
</p>
<p>Even though this Python framework is typically used for Fault Injection attacks, it can be used conveniently for SCA acquisition as well.</p>
<h2 id="acquisition-speed">Acquisition speed</h2>
<p>The acquisition speed of your measurements is typically quite important when performing a side channel attack. There is typically a minimum amount of measurements required to extract the entire key.</p>
<p>Throughout our research we used two acquisition techniques that are supported by our oscilloscope: <em>normal block mode</em> and <em>rapid block mode</em>. We used <a href="https://github.com/picotech/picosdk-python-wrappers">Picoscope&rsquo;s Python bindings</a> to communicate with the oscilloscope. We used their <a href="https://github.com/picotech/picosdk-python-wrappers/blob/master/ps3000aExamples/ps3000aRapidBlockExample.py">ps3000aRapidBlockExample.py</a> as a reference to integrate <em>rapid block mode</em> into Riscure&rsquo;s FiPy.</p>
<p>In <em>normal block mode</em> we initiate a single cryptographic operation in order to measure the power consumption. This means that the overhead for communicating with both the target and oscilloscope is there for each measurement. Using <em>rapid block mode</em>, we can minimize this overhead by initiating multiple cryptographic operations, which are measured by the oscilloscope, and then sent all at once back to the workstation. This allows us, as you will find out after reading this entire blog post, to acquire traces much faster.</p>
<h2 id="inputoutput-correlation">Input/Output correlation</h2>
<p>Using <em>normal block mode</em>, we acquire 1M traces in ~9 hours while the hardware AES engine is encrypting random input data. We use Riscure&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-sca/">Inspector</a> software to compute the input and output correlation which is shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/power-input-correlation.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Input correlation</figcaption>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/power-output-correlation.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Output correlation</figcaption>
</p>
<p>We can use the input and output correlation to determine that the AES operation is performed between 150 μs and 180 μs. In principle, we can use this information to decrease our attack window from the moment the trigger goes up and down to the mount we see input and output correlation. This will decrease the amount of samples we need to measure and transfer, which will increase the acquisition speed.</p>
<h2 id="known-key-correlation">Known Key Correlation</h2>
<p>We use the same trace set, containing 1M traces, to compute the correlation with intermediate values. We used the <em>Known Key Correlation</em> module from Riscure&rsquo;s Inspector software to compute the correlation with the default intermediates that can be attacked (e.g., <code>HW(S-Box output)</code>, <code>HD(S-Box input ^ S-Box output)</code>, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/esp32-power-known-key-correlation-module.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Riscure's Known Key Correlation module</figcaption>
</p>
<p>The output of this module shows that the hardware AES engine leaks the Hamming Weight (HW) of the S-Box output, a typical leakage model for AES implementations. The output trace below shows the correlation for each key byte intermediate (i.e., 16 in total). The leakage is significant for all key byte intermediates at sample 400 which translates to roughly 1.6 μs after the trigger up signal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/esp32-power-known-key-correlation-trace.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Intermediate correlation (Hamming Weight of S-Box output)</figcaption>
</p>
<p>The other peaks are likely ghost peaks that can be safely ignored as they do not appear at the same time for each  key byte intermediate (i.e., something you would expect from a hardware AES implementation).</p>
<p>We observe no significant peaks for the Hamming Distance (HD) of the S-Box input and S-Box output, another typical leakage model for AES implementations, as shown in the picture below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/esp32-power-known-key-correlation-trace2.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Intermediate correlation (Hamming Distance of S-Box input / S-Box output)</figcaption>
</p>
<p>The peaks that are there are likely ghost peaks that can again be safely ignored for similar reasons as before. From this point on we will only consider the HW of S-Box output as leakage model for our attacks.</p>
<h2 id="known-key-analysis">Known Key Analysis</h2>
<p>We used the <em>Known Key Analysis</em> module from Riscure&rsquo;s Inspector software, using the same trace set, to perform a known key analysis. This is useful for determining how many traces are required to extract the entire key. Moreover, even if you do not extract the key, it gives an idea of how many more traces you need to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/power-known-key-analysis-module.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Riscure's Known Key Analysis module</figcaption>
</p>
<p>We applied known key analysis to samples from 390 to 410, whose output is shown below. On the left side, an heat map provides an indication of the leakage for each fragment (i.e., sample). This output shows that significant leakage is present at fragment 9 (i.e., sample 399).</p>
<p>The output of this module can be used to determine how high the correct key byte ranks among all the possible key bytes. When we run this module only 50k traces, we are unable to recover the key as is shown in the output below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/img/esp32/sca/resized/power-known-key-analysis-result2.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px">
    <figcaption>Riscure's Known Key Analysis module output</figcaption>
</p>
<p>By looking at the key ranking, another output of this module, we indeed determine that not all correct key bytes rank the highest. This is a clear indication that the correlation found is not significant enough for the amount of traces analyzed.</p>

<p>When this module is re-run using 200,000 traces, we are able to recover the key entirely. Interestingly, the leakage in fragment 12 (i.e., sample 402) seems more significant than in other fragments. The plot for fragment 12 shows that all key bytes actually already converge to 0 after 140,000 traces.</p>

<p>By analyzing the key ranking, we see that this time all key bytes rank the highest. This is a clear indication that the correlation found is now significant enough to extract the entire key.</p>

<p>We can now use the information obtained from the known key analysis to perform our attack where we aim to extract an unknown key.</p>
<h2 id="first-order-analysis">First Order Analysis</h2>
<p>During a real attack scenario, the attacker is supposed not to have knowledge of the key. A side-channel attack is supposed to be executed in absence of such knowledge. This can be done using Riscure&rsquo;s First Order Analysis module which is shown below.</p>

<p>The output of this module after 50,000 traces is shown below. We already know from the known key analysis that the intermediate correlation, with this amount of traces, is not significant enough for extracting the entire key. Interestingly, we were still able to extract the key by brute forcing the incorrect key byte guesses.</p>

<p>Acquiring 200,000 traces may sound like an hefty requirement to extract the entire key, especially considering it takes multiple hours to acquire such a trace set. To lower this requirement, as an attacker you have basically two options, make the analysis more efficient (i.e., less traces are required) or increase the acquisition speed. We chose the latter&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="speeding-up-the-attack">Speeding up the attack</h2>
<p>Now that we have all ingredients (i.e., leakage model and timing), we can cook up an approach for recovering the key as fast as possible. We use the following strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Picoscope&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.picotech.com/helpfiles/6000a-api/rapidblockmode.html">Rapid Block Mode</a>, inspired by the work of <a href="https://github.com/Riscure/Jlsca/blob/master/examples/piposcope.jl">ceesb</a>), which allows us to measure multiple cryptographic operations per acquisition in order to minimize the communication overhead.</li>
<li>Only acquire the sample(s) that leaks well (e.g., sample 410).</li>
<li>Use the hardware SHA1 engine to generate inputs for each encryption operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we are randomizing the data for each encryption, we need to generate the input data for the encryption operation executed on the device. This is typically done offline (i.e., on our workstation), but this requires sending input data for each iteration of the encryption operation. This slows down the acquisition significantly, hence we benefit of measuring multiple cryptographic operation in a single communication cycle.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to use the hardware SHA1 accelerator present on the target to deterministically derive semi-random inputs, out of a randomized seed received from our workstation. We could also leverage another cryptographic engine, even the AES engine itself, to accomplish the same, likely even faster. The modified encryption loop on the ESP32 chip is shown below.</p>

<p>To summarize, by combining Picoscope&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.picotech.com/helpfiles/6000a-api/rapidblockmode.html">Rapid Block Mode</a>, Riscure&rsquo;s FiPy and Riscure&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/Riscure/Jlsca">Jlsca</a> toolkit, we are able to acquire 200,000 traces and perform the CPA attack in order to extract the entire key in ~25 seconds, without any brute forcing.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>Power analysis attacks on cryptographic algorithms, like AES, are known to be effective for over multiple decades. Therefore, it&rsquo;s not surprising at all, that the ESP32&rsquo;s hardware AES engine is vulnerable to a straight-forward power analysis attack. It&rsquo;s simply not protected against such threats.</p>
<p>The abundance of available tooling and knowledge in today&rsquo;s world definitely decreases the complexity for extracting cryptographic keys.</p>

<p>Where it used to take an attacker with an <em>Expert skill-level</em> to perform these type of attacks on cryptographic implementations, it can nowadays be successfully performed by attackers with an <em>Intermediate skill-level</em>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, when cryptographic algorithms are sufficiently hardened by using dedicated countermeasures (e.g., random masking, random delays, noise generation, parallel execution, etc.), it may not be so trivial to perform a successful attack.</p>
<p>In our next blog post, we will perform a similar attack by measuring the electromagnetic emissions emitted from the chip. But, for now, we hope you have enjoyed this write-up.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out for questions or remarks related to this research. As always, we are available to give training related to our research, during which you will gain hands-on experience exploiting the vulnerabilities described in this blog post.</p>
